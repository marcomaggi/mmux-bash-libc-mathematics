1. Introduction
---------------

This package  implements additional  builtin commands  for the  GNU Bash
shell; to  do so  it installs a  C language library  and a  shell script
which is meant to be sourced in  a Bash session or script.  The bulitins
implement interfaces  to standard C Library's  mathematics functions for
"double float" and "complex double float" number representations.

  This package  targets POSIX systems.   Only for testing:  this package
depends on the external package MBFL (at least version v3.0.0-devel.8).

  The  package uses  the GNU  Autotools and  it is  tested on  GNU+Linux
systems.  The  package relies on  "pkg-config" to find  the dependencies
installed on the system.

3. Install
----------

To install from a proper release tarball, do this:

    $ cd mmux-bash-libc-mathematics-0.1.0
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ ../configure
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install

to inspect the available configuration options:

    $ ../configure --help

  By default the  configuration searches for the package  MBFL to enable
testing;  to  disable this  search:  when  configuring, use  the  option
"--disable-mbfl".

  The Makefile is designed to allow parallel builds, so we can do:

   $ make -j4 all && make -j4 check

which,  on  a  4-core  CPU,   should  speed  up  building  and  checking
significantly.

  The  Makefile supports  the  DESTDIR environment  variable to  install
files in a temporary location, example: to see what will happen:

    $ make -n install DESTDIR=/tmp/mmux-bash-libc-mathematics

to really do it:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/mmux-bash-libc-mathematics

  After the installation it is  possible to verify the installed library
against the test suite with:

    $ make installcheck

  From  a repository  checkout or  snapshot  (the ones  from the  GitHub
site): we  must install the  GNU Autotools (GNU Automake,  GNU Autoconf,
GNU Libtool),  then we must first  run the script "autogen.sh"  from the
top source directory, to generate the needed files:

    $ cd mmux-bash-libc-mathematics
    $ sh autogen.sh

notice  that  "autogen.sh"  will   run  the  programs  "autoreconf"  and
"libtoolize"; the  latter is  selected through the  environment variable
"LIBTOOLIZE",  whose  value  can  be  customised;  for  example  to  run
"glibtoolize" rather than "libtoolize" we do:

   $ LIBTOOLIZE=glibtoolize sh autogen.sh

  After this the  procedure is the same  as the one for  building from a
proper release tarball, but we have to enable maintainer mode:

    $ ../configure --enable-maintainer-mode [options]
    $ make
    $ make check
    $ make install


4. Usage
--------

Read the documentation generated from  the Texinfo sources.  The package
installs the documentation  in Info format; we can  generate and install
documentation in HTML format by running:

   $ make html
   $ make install-html


A. Credits
----------

The  stuff was  written by  Marco Maggi.   If this  package exists  it's
because of the great GNU software tools that he uses all the time.
